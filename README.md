### About the project
This project is centred on the topic of road safety and educating people (especially kids) about it through various games where users are expected to learn about traffic hand signals and road signs.
#### Traffic Hand Signals

Now isn't it embarrassing when the traffic policeman plays dumb charades with us? well, it's time to figure those out finally!!</p>

<p>Hand signals can be used to direct traffic, alert others to potential dangers, and signal when it's safe to stop or exit a roadway. Simple hand signals ensure that everyone is communicating effectively.</p>

#### Road Signs

Having trouble recognizing road signs during your trip? Rush to our site for an escape, just point the camera at the sign to reveal it's meaning!

<p> The purpose of these signs is to alert drivers to potential dangers or situations on the road ahead. For their own safety, the driver must abide by these. </p>
<p> Despite the fact that disobeying these traffic signs will not result in legal consequences, they are very significant because doing so could cause serious accidents</p>

You say it and we'll show you the correct road sign pop up on the screen!</p>

<p>There have been several studies on the possible advantages of learning to speak aloud, including this one from 1962. According to a recent study, speaking words out improves memory compared to thinking them. Speaking the words out loud improves memory retention over simply contemplating them.</p>
